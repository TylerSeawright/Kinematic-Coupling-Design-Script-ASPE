% AUTHOR'S NOTE
% This script was created through the work of Dr. Alexander Slocum, Michel
% Pharand, and Tyler Seawright. 

% With this script, 2D and 3D kinematic
% couplings consisting of three balls and three vees may be solved. Use to
% determine contact points, contact forces, contact stresses, deformations. 
% The script will additionally output error at points of interest.
% 
% Applications include kinematic coupling design, tolerance analysis, sensitivity analysis,
% error budgeting.
%
% Edit the config file to change the input parameters. Unsupported features are
% listed.
